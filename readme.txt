Beyond alpha version of a plugin for a museum collection-based game.

== Description ==

mmg is a WordPress plugin for a set of metadata games based around museum collections. 
Not included (for now) is the museumobjectsimport script that is used to get data into the matchy_objects table for use in the game.  Data is sourced from the collections of the UK's Science Museum, Sydney's Powerhouse Museum and the British Library.

Plugins used in the old (2011) version with WordPress 3.0 were:
contact-form-7/wp-contact-form-7.php 
cubepoints/cubepoints.php 
google-analyticator/google-analyticator.php 
mmg/mmg.php 
session-manager/session_manager.php 
share-and-follow/share-and-follow.php

Theme was: Thematic with a child theme

This list needs to be updated after re-development with whatever plugins and themes are still used.
