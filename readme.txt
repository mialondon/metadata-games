Beyond alpha version of a plugin for a museum collection-based game.

== Description ==

mmg is a plugin for a set of metadata games based around museum collections.

Not included (for now) is the museumobjectsimport script that is used to get data into the matchy_objects table for use in the game.  Data is sourced from the collections of the Science Museum and possibly also the Powerhouse Museum and Museum Victoria.

(Was called 'matchymatchy' in its very first incarnation)
